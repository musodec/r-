Unfortunately we have two different implementations:
one for recursive traversal and another for the
single-directory case.  Glob doesn't appear to
support recursion (I've tried it with "**/*~"
and the like) whereas to invoke rDir from walkFunc
would trip up the walk by removing files that were
there just a moment ago.

Ultimately perhaps a custom traversal routine may be
better: avoid the above split/duplication of
implementation + avoid the waste of sort in Walk.

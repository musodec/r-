Unfortunately we have two different implementations:
one for recursive traversal and another for the
single-directory case.  Glob doesn't appear to
support recursion (I've tried it with "**/*~"
and the like) whereas to invoke rDir from walkFunc
would trip up the walk by removing files that were
there just a moment ago.

Ultimately perhaps a custom traversal routine may be
better: avoid the above split/duplication of
implementation + avoid the waste of sort in Walk.

Global exitCode with its own type is a little clunky,
but it does effectively coerce exit values to be
one such ExitCode, for all non-panic termination.
It also facilitates potential flag bit-wise OR of
multiple exit causes, if ever needed in future.
The hard error return type of WalkFunc means that
wrapping & unwrapping of errors from walkFunc
would have been necessary for a more functional
approach.  Arguably, this would have been even
more clunky.
